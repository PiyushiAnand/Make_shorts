# Make_shorts
This is a python code that can make a 30 second reel/short video from a longer video.All you have to do is to give the relevant part of the longer videos as clippings.
The main code is a Jupyter Notebook,input video with the output video has also been provided.
Input video has been taken from here(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3RIHnK0_NE)
Output video is the final output.
The sound track(hiphop4.mp3) for the background has been composed by me(Yes I do a lil music production too)
