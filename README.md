# Make_shorts

This Python code generates a 30-second reel or short video from a longer video. You need to provide relevant clippings from the longer video, and the code will concatenate them to create the final output.

The main code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook, along with an input video and the corresponding output video.

- Input video source: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3RIHnK0_NE)
- Output video: Final output video

The background soundtrack, "hiphop4.mp3," has been composed by me(Yes, I do lil music production too).
